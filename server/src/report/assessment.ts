/**
 * Quantum Readiness Assessment — the structured model behind QuantumVault's
 * flagship report. It turns the raw output of a scan (scored assets + compliance
 * reports) into the executive-ready narrative an organization needs to brief a
 * CISO and plan a post-quantum migration: an at-a-glance posture grade, a
 * cryptographic inventory, a prioritized worklist, the real top findings, a
 * compliance gap matrix, and a phased roadmap.
 *
 * Everything here is computed from real scan data — there is no sample/fiction.
 * The renderer (`assessmentHtml.ts`) is a pure view over this model, so the same
 * assessment can be emitted as HTML (print-to-PDF) or JSON (system of record).
